# toyrouter - simple linux router built from scratch

Stripped to bare essentials, a programming exercise in making it as simple as possible.

Only uses busybox and iptables in user space. Probably the simplest router you will find.

Installs over Ubuntu by creating a new entry in the boot menu. Uses overlayfs without modifying the Ubuntu user space. 

Combines the simplicity of a busybox user space with the ease of installation of Ubuntu.
