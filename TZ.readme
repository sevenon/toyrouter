timezone setting for busybox (uclibc)
busybox expects /etc/TZ in an exact format
treat /etc/TZ as a binary file, don't use a text editor to create
busybox reads this file and could keep it in memory, reboot after changing /etc/TZ

create /etc/TZ with the echo command, for example:
echo "AEST-10AEDT,M10.1.0,M4.1.0/3" >/etc/TZ
